Double Chicken Please
115 Allen St, New York, NY 10002, United States
cocktails, food, favourite

My vote for the best cocktails in NYC. The front room is casual with chicken sandwiches (and a tofu option) with cocktails on tap, and there's a world-class, sit-down cocktail bar in the back.

Jelas
17 E 13th St, New York, NY 10003, United States
cocktails

Niche pick but worth a visit, a menu of 20+ clarified cocktails of all sorts. They no longer do tasting flights unfortunately, so best to visit with a big group and share a bunch of drinks.

Superiority Burger
119 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009, United States
food

Candidly, liked it a lot more when it was a takeout basement spot with a small $6 burger. Now it's quite a bit more expensive ($14) but still a uniquely good veggie burger. Worth a visit for vegetarians / vegans if you're in the area.

Massara
913 Broadway, New York, NY 10010, United States
food, wine, favourite

Potentially the best pasta I've had in my life. Freshly made, feels like the grown-up sequel to its sister restaurant Rezdora.

Souvlaki GR
116 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002, United States
food, wine

Small greek restaurant with incredible pitas and interesting Greek wines. Practically everything on the menu is a hit.

Comedy Cellar
117 MacDougal St, New York, NY 10012, United States
activity, favourite

So great that it's on this list despite it being such a commonly recommended activity. Hilarious, world-class comedy any day of the week, with a decent chance someone famous will do a set.

L'industrie 
104 Christopher St, New York, NY 10014, United States
food, favourite

L'industrie doesn't have salads, pastas, apps - they just do pizza and they do it incredibly well. My vote for the best slice in NYC. More of a thin & crispy Roman-style than Neapolitan.

Legendary cocktail bar and restaurant with a line that never disappates. Super friendly servers, great food, and great drinks.
