Mastard
Mastard
food

$85 tasting menus with a $50-$60 wine pairing. Technically it's "fine dining" but with the casual + laid-back vibe of most Montreal restaurants.

My favourite place in the entire city. Open from ~9:00 to 2:00: coffee, brunch, lunch, dinner, beer, cocktails, they have it all. The veggie burger and foccacia are both amazing.

Patati Pattata
Patati Pattata
food, favourite

Hole-in-the-wall poutine spot, and I'd argue the best poutine in Montreal. Squeeky cheese, light but delicious gravy, and a great cheese to fries ratio. The (tofu) demontignac is also great.

Moccione
Moccione
food, favourite

High-end Italian restaurant with a great wine list. The pastas are amazing. A bit far out but worth the trip; probably the best (vegetarian-friendly) Italian restaurant in the city.

Atwater Cocktail Club

cocktails, food, favourite

Probably the best cocktails in the city; the entire menu is unique and delicious, but worth visiting just to try the "Pokemango". Small food menu from the sister restaurant as well.

Cloakroom
Cloakroom
cocktails, favourite

"No menu" cocktail bar, my recommendation is to ask for a full cocktail made out of the welcome shooter. Small space (25 seats) so best visited early or during weekdays.

Known for their pizzas but their pastas are pretty amazing as well. If they have any stuffed pastas on the menu, definitely worth getting. A really nice wine list as well.

food, wine, favourite

Small plates and wine in a low-key but loud & lively atmosphere. Somehow always busy and always a good time, with a menu that changes often.

Incredibly good cocktails with a bright and cool interior. Upstairs from a great pizza shop that you can order from.

Bar Mamie

food, wine

Great wine, lots of orange, natural, organic, biodynamic, funky stuff. The servers are also great, and will work with you to find a glass you love, even if you know nothing about wine.

Sans Soleil
Sans Soleil
cocktails, party

Weirdly good cocktails for a place that gets pretty dancy. If you show up before 22:30 your odds of getting in are much higher (turns clubby with a huge line after then).

Stereo
Stereo
party

Legendary club with a SUPER high-end sound system and world-class DJs. Almost exclusively EDM/techno, but worth visiting to live the experience even if you're not into the music.
