Mastard
1879 Rue Bélanger, Montréal, QC H2G 1B6
food

$85 tasting menus with a $50-$60 wine pairing. Technically it's "fine dining" but with the casual + laid-back vibe of most Montreal restaurants.

Le Darling
4328 St Laurent Blvd, Montreal, Quebec H2W 1Z3
coffee, beer, food, work, favourite

My favourite place in the entire city. Open from ~9:00 to 2:00: coffee, brunch, lunch, dinner, beer, cocktails, they have it all. The veggie burger and foccacia are both amazing.

Patati Patata
4177 St Laurent Blvd, Montreal, Quebec H2W 1Y7
food, favourite

Hole-in-the-wall poutine spot, and I'd argue the best poutine in Montreal. Squeeky cheese, light but delicious gravy, and a great cheese to fries ratio. The (tofu) demontignac is also great.

Moccione
7495 Saint Denis St, Montreal, Quebec H2R 2E5
food, favourite

High-end Italian restaurant with a great wine list. The pastas are amazing. A bit far out but worth the trip; probably the best (vegetarian-friendly) Italian restaurant in the city.

Atwater Cocktail Club
512 Atwater Ave, Montreal, Quebec H4C 2G5
cocktails, food, favourite

Probably the best cocktails in the city; the entire menu is unique and delicious, but worth visiting just to try the "Pokemango". Small food menu from the sister restaurant as well.

Cloakroom
2175 Rue de la Montagne #100, Montréal, QC H3G 1Z8
cocktails, favourite

"No menu" cocktail bar, my recommendation is to ask for a full cocktail made out of the welcome shooter. Small space (25 seats) so best visited early or during weekdays.

Elena
5090 Notre-Dame St W, Montreal, Quebec H4C 1T1
food, wine, favourite

Known for their pizzas but their pastas are pretty amazing as well. If they have any stuffed pastas on the menu, definitely worth getting. A really nice wine list as well.

---

La Buvette Chez Simone
4869 Park Ave, Montreal, Quebec H2V 4E7
food, wine, favourite

Small plates and wine in a low-key but loud & lively atmosphere. Somehow always busy and always a good time, with a menu that changes often.

---

Milky Way Cocktail Bar
1886 Centre St, Montreal, Quebec H3K 1H9
food, cocktails

Incredibly good cocktails with a bright and cool interior. Upstairs from a great pizza shop that you can order from.

---

Mamie
328 Rue Beaubien E, Montréal, QC H2S 1R8
food, wine

Great wine, lots of orange, natural, organic, biodynamic, funky stuff. The servers are also great, and will work with you to find a glass you love, even if you know nothing about wine.

---

Sans Soleil
1002 Rue Saint-Urbain, Montréal, QC H2Z 1K6
cocktails, party

Weirdly good cocktails for a place that gets pretty dancy. If you show up before 22:30 your odds of getting in are much higher (turns clubby with a huge line after then).

---

Stereo
858 St Catherine St E, Montreal, Quebec H2L 2E3
party

Legendary club with a SUPER high-end sound system and world-class DJs. Almost exclusively EDM/techno, but worth visiting to live the experience even if you're not into the music.
