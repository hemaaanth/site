drink

Great atmosphere, incredibly friendly staff, with delicious food and drink. DJ most days of the week from about 20:30, and the same owner as Noir which is 6 doors north and has live jazz from 21:45. Suggest doing the two back-to-back.

About a ~1hr drive from the main city. The coffee is incredible, and the building overlooks the surrounding mountains. Very serene, great place to visit with a book and spend a few hours.

Some of the best coffee in Chiang Mai. Half the price (40THB) compared to most specialty places in the city. Very chill vibe, good spot to sit for a few hours or grab a coffee to go.
