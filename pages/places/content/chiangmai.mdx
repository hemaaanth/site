Great atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious food & drink. DJ from ~20:30, and 6 doors down from Noir which has live jazz from 21:45. Suggest doing the two back-to-back.

First Valley Coffee Academy

About a ~1hr drive from the main city. The coffee is incredible, and the building overlooks the surrounding mountains. Very serene, great place to visit with a book and spend a few hours.

Buncha's Slow Cafe
102 Charoen Prathet Rd, Tambon Chang Khlan, Mueang Chiang Mai District, Chiang Mai 50100
coffee

Some of the best coffee in Chiang Mai. Half the price (40THB) compared to most specialty places in the city. Very chill vibe, good spot to sit for a few hours or grab a coffee to go.

An ode to specialty espresso. Award-winning roastery, baristas, and latte art champions. The building is also gorgeous, with a minimial, modern, concrete-heavy interior + exterior.

Midlife Crisis
Chang Moi Kao Rd, Tambon Chang Moi, Mueang Chiang Mai District, Chiang Mai 50300, Thailand
drink, work

Speakeasy-ish bar upstairs in a cafe with great cocktails and a great atmosphere. Have a location in Bangkok as well but I think this one is much better. Open quite late.

Bar Not Found
161, 90-91 Sri Phum, Tambon Si Phum, Muang, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand
drink

Probably the most "gastronomic" cocktail bar in Chiang Mai. Drinks unlike anything else in the city with unique ingredients and a unique menu concept overall. Great music and friendly staff.

Very nice boutique perfume shop with a cool interior, very friendly staff; let me try 30+ perfumes with no pressure to buy. Very reasonably priced for the quality. Great place to get a gift.
