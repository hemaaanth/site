Post
Córdoba 223, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
coffee, favourite

Small, hip, aesthetic, and VERY high quality coffee. Good place to hang out with a book, not a great place to work. On a quiet street which really adds to the vibe.

Quentin
Ámsterdam 67a, Hipódromo, Cuauhtémoc, 06100 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
coffee, favourite

Best espresso in the city. Cool atmosphere, great location, good pastries (made fresh at their other location I think). Not sure why but there's almost always a ton of cute dogs around.

Maximo
Av. Álvaro Obregón 65 Bis, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
food, favourite

There is a LOT of good food in CDMX so it's hard to pick for the shortlist. But Maximo at the time had a croissant + french onion soup that I'd kill for. Worth going just for that.

Taqueria Gabriel
C. Río Sena 87-Local A, Cuauhtémoc, 06500 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
food

Caveat: I'm vegetarian. But I'd say Gabriel has the best (easily accessible, reasonably priced) tacos in the city. They also have great merch and these spicy tangy chips that are incredible.

Lardo
Agustín Melgar 6, Colonia Condesa, Cuauhtémoc, 06140 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
food, favourite

Similar to Maximo - there's a LOT of good food in CDMX but Lardo specifically makes the cut, a. for the best taste-per-dollar ratio, and b. their simple but fresh, must-try, 40MXN bread.

WeWork Reforma
Av. P.º de la Reforma 296, Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, 06600 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
work

SUPER nice place to get some work done. Great views, tons of floors so you can always get a booth, well located, and very affordable. Nitro cold brew on top and a ping pong table.

Phoenix
Cadereyta 16, Colonia Condesa, Cuauhtémoc, 06140 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
party

A locals' club with great music and great energy. There's a small bar in the back corner that for some reason serves INCREDIBLY good G&Ts. They really only close when the last person leaves.

Enigma Rooms 2
Colima 367-Piso 1, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
activity, favourite

INSANE escape room, probably the highest production-value in the world (at least that I've heard of). There's a "horror escape room" at this location that is nuts.

Yeccan
Calle Chiapas 208, Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
beer, food, favourite

CDMX is has world class food and drink, but generally lacks on craft beer. Yeccan is the one place that challenges that. If you're ever craving a few crisp lagers and hazy IPAs, this is the spot.
