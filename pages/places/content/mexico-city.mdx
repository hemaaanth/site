Hule
Av Michoacán 75, Colonia Condesa, Cuauhtémoc, 06100 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
coffee

Best dirty chai I've ever had. Has a really nice (but narrow) back patio. Curated vinyl selection. Small number of indoor tables to get work done, but wouldn't suggest it.

Quentin
Ámsterdam 67a, Hipódromo, Cuauhtémoc, 06100 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
coffee

Best espresso in the city. Cool atmosphere, great location, good pastries (made fresh at their other location I think). Not sure why but there's almost always a ton of cute dogs around.

Maximo
Av. Álvaro Obregón 65 Bis, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
food

There is a LOT of good food in CDMX so it's hard to pick for the shortlist. But Maximo at the time had a croissant + french onion soup that I'd kill for. Worth going just for that.

Taqueria Gabriel
C. Río Sena 87-Local A, Cuauhtémoc, 06500 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
food

Caveat: I'm vegetarian. But I'd say Gabriel has the best (easily accessible, reasonably priced) tacos in the city. They also have great merch and these spicy tangy chips that are incredible.

Lardo
Agustín Melgar 6, Colonia Condesa, Cuauhtémoc, 06140 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
food

Similar to the point above on Maximo - a LOT of good food but Lardo specifically makes the cut for the best taste-per-dollar ratio, and a simple but fresh, must-try, 40MXN bread.

---

Baltra
Iztaccihuatl 36D, Colonia Condesa, Cuauhtémoc, 06100 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
drink

Tons of great cocktails, but Baltra's the spot with the one drink that I remember the most. It's a small bar so you'll probably be outside, but get the Sumi.

---

WeWork Reforma
Av. P.º de la Reforma 296, Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, 06600 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
work

SUPER nice place to get some work done. Great views, tons of floors so you can always get a booth, well located, and very affordable. Nitro cold brew on top and a ping pong table.

---

Phoenix
Cadereyta 16, Colonia Condesa, Cuauhtémoc, 06140 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
party

A locals' club with great music and great energy. There's a small bar in the back corner that for some reason serves INCREDIBLY good G&Ts. They really only close when the last person leaves.

---

Enigma Rooms 2
Colima 367-Piso 1, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
activity

INSANE escape room, probably the highest production-value in the world (at least that I've heard of). There's a "horror escape room" at this location that is nuts.

---

Yeccan
C. de Chiapas 208, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
drink

CDMX is has world class food and drink, but generally lacks on craft beer. Yeccan is the one place that challenges that. If you're ever craving a few crisp lagers and hazy IPAs, this is the spot.
