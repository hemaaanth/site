Post
Córdoba 223, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
coffee, favourite

Small, hip, aesthetic, and VERY high quality coffee. Good place to hang out with a book, not a great place to work. On a quiet street which really adds to the vibe.

---

Suppli
Bucareli 69b, Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, 06600 Ciudad de México, CDMX
food

Small Italian trattoria with simple but delicious pasta. Fast service, with fresh and local ingredients.
---

Libertario
C. Orizaba 16, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX
coffee

Great coffee and tons of space to work. Section with a bunch of plants and a sunroof in the back.

---

Sonambulo
C. Chilpancingo 35, Hipódromo, Cuauhtémoc, 06100 Ciudad de México, CDMX
coffee

Small coffee shop with a minimalist concrete interior. Alongside Quentin and Post, some of the tastiest espresso in CDMX.

---

Tetetlan
Av. de Las Fuentes 180 - B, Jardines del Pedregal, Álvaro Obregón, 01900 Ciudad de México, CDMX
food

Incredibly beautiful and unique restaurant with a glass floor, exposing volcanic rock underneath. Cafe on the mezzanine floor with tons of books and records. Food and drink is pretty good.

---

Fabrica Cervecera Bucareli
Bucareli 80, Colonia Centro, Centro, Cuauhtémoc, 06040 Ciudad de México, CDMX
beer

Cool little hole in a wall with a rotating set of local beers (some of which I think are brewed on site).

---

Bacal
Av. Baja California 158, Roma Sur, Cuauhtémoc, 06760 Ciudad de México, CDMX
cocktails, food

Eclectic dinner and drinks. Mostly Mediterranean small plates, with guest chefs several times a week bringing special menus.

---

Outline
Av Oaxaca 99, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX
cocktails

Huge space with 20+ (great) cocktails on tap, making it a good spot for large groups. Music is weirdly loud and the food isn't great, but it's hard to beat for a casual drink.

---

Cocina Candelaria
Liverpool 46, Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, 06600 Ciudad de México, CDMX
food

Tacos and burgers made fresh in a huge firepit, in a large sunlit warehouse with ping pong tables.

---

Tlecan
Av. Álvaro Obregón 228-Local 2, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX
cocktails

Mezcal bar with unique atmosphere (dark, red, smoky, mysterious) with incredibly knowledgeable bartenders. Known for straight tastings, but the cocktails are great too.

---

Hanky Panky
Turín 52, Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, 06600 Ciudad de México, CDMX
cocktails

One of the legendary cocktail bars in the city and on many "best of" lists, but for a good reason. Menu has been refreshed a few times and every iteration is as good as the last.

---

Malix
Av. Isaac Newton 104-Local 2 y 3, Polanco, Polanco V Secc, Miguel Hidalgo, 11560 Ciudad de México, CDMX
food

Casual but high-end dining with a very nice interior. Can always count on a few dishes (menu changes often, so ask for recommendations) that are an undeniable 10/10.

---

Quentin
Ámsterdam 67a, Hipódromo, Cuauhtémoc, 06100 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
coffee, favourite

Best espresso in the city. Cool atmosphere, great location, good pastries (made fresh at their other location I think). Not sure why but there's almost always a ton of cute dogs around.

---

Maximo
Av. Álvaro Obregón 65 Bis, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
food, favourite

There is a LOT of good food in CDMX so it's hard to pick for the shortlist. But Maximo at the time had a croissant + french onion soup that I'd kill for. Worth going just for that.

---

Taqueria Gabriel
C. Río Sena 87-Local A, Cuauhtémoc, 06500 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
food

Caveat: I'm vegetarian. But I'd say Gabriel has the best (easily accessible, reasonably priced) tacos in the city. They also have great merch and these spicy tangy chips that are incredible.

---

Lardo
Agustín Melgar 6, Colonia Condesa, Cuauhtémoc, 06140 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
food, favourite

Similar to Maximo - there's a LOT of good food in CDMX but Lardo specifically makes the cut, a. for the best taste-per-dollar ratio, and b. their simple but fresh, must-try, 40MXN bread.

---

WeWork Reforma
Av. P.º de la Reforma 296, Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, 06600 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
work

SUPER nice place to get some work done. Great views, tons of floors so you can always get a booth, well located, and very affordable. Nitro cold brew on top and a ping pong table.

---

Phoenix
Cadereyta 16, Colonia Condesa, Cuauhtémoc, 06140 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
party

A locals' club with great music and great energy. There's a small bar in the back corner that for some reason serves INCREDIBLY good G&Ts. They really only close when the last person leaves.

---

Enigma Rooms 2
Colima 367-Piso 1, Roma Nte., Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
activity, favourite

INSANE escape room, probably the highest production-value in the world (at least that I've heard of). There's a "horror escape room" at this location that is nuts.

---

Yeccan
Calle Chiapas 208, Cuauhtémoc, 06700 Ciudad de México, CDMX, Mexico
beer, food, favourite

CDMX is has world class food and drink, but generally lacks on craft beer. Yeccan is the one place that challenges that. If you're ever craving a few crisp lagers and hazy IPAs, this is the spot.
