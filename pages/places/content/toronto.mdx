Drom Toberna
Drom Toberna
party, cocktails, favourite

Lively casual bar with live music (every night) and a great atmosphere. Open late on weekends (~4:00) with a rotating selection of weird and delicious infusions.

Mother
874 Queen St W, Toronto, ON M6J 1G3, Canada
cocktails, favourite

Best cocktails in the city, worth visiting just to try the "claire de lune". Lots of other hits on the menu as well. Interior is a bit of a dark (but lively) escape from Queen Street.

Ten
1132 College St, Toronto, ON M6H 1B6, Canada
food, favourite

10 seat restaurant with a 10-course tasting menus. Can also get food a-la-carte (no menu, as available) in the front room, making tasting-menu-level dishes much more casual.

Roti Mahal
554 Queen St W, Toronto, ON M5V 2B7, Canada
food, favourite

Hole-in-the-wall Indian food, with a good selection of vegetarian options. I'm Indian and it's probably the only Indian restaurant I know of that I can recommend in Toronto.

Dailo
503 College St, Toronto, ON M6G 1A5, Canada
food

It's mostly "just fine" but the pumpkin dumplings - when they're on the menu - are to die for. Check the menu online, and call ahead to see if they're serving them.

Reyna on King
354 King St E, Toronto, ON M5A 1K9, Canada
food, cocktails

Great ambience, food, drinks, probably the best of all three in the downtown east area. Lots of small bites to share and 3-4 different options for fries.

---

Beerbistro
18 King St E, Toronto, ON M5C 1C4, Canada
food

Not a super notable spot other than the fries, which I think are the best fries in the city. It's in the downtown core and a common after-work hangout spot.
