Drom Toberna
458 Queen St W, Toronto, ON M5V 2A8, Canada
party, cocktails, favourite

Lively casual bar with live music (every night) and a great atmosphere. Open late on weekends (~4:00) with a rotating selection of weird and delicious infusions.

Mother
874 Queen St W, Toronto, ON M6J 1G3, Canada
cocktails, favourite

Best cocktails in the city, worth visiting just to try the "claire de lune". Lots of other hits on the menu as well. Interior is a bit of a dark (but lively) escape from Queen Street.

Ten
1132 College St, Toronto, ON M6H 1B6, Canada
food, favourite

10 seat restaurant with a 10-course tasting menus. Can also get food a-la-carte (no menu, as available) in the front room, making tasting-menu-level dishes much more casual.

Roti Mahal
554 Queen St W, Toronto, ON M5V 2B7, Canada
food, favourite

Hole-in-the-wall Indian food, with a good selection of vegetarian options. I'm Indian and it's probably the only Indian restaurant I know of that I can recommend in Toronto.

Dailo
503 College St, Toronto, ON M6G 1A5, Canada
food

It's mostly "just fine" but the pumpkin dumplings - when they're on the menu - are to die for. Check the menu online, and call ahead to see if they're serving them.

Reyna on King
354 King St E, Toronto, ON M5A 1K9, Canada
food, cocktails

Great ambience, food, drinks, probably the best of all three in the downtown east area. Lots of small bites to share and 3-4 different options for fries.

Creed's Coffee Bar
450 Dupont St, Toronto, ON M5R 3P3, Canada
work

It's called a "coffee bar," but the coffee is horrible. It still makes it onto the list because it's huge, has great natural light and plenty of outlets, making it a great spot to work from.

Rooms
915 Dupont St, Toronto, ON M6H 1Z1, Canada
coffee, cocktails

Unique ambiance; it's a coffee shop by day and a cocktail bar by night, with a pretty great sound system.
