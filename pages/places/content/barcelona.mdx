Dr. Stravinsky
Carrer dels Mirallers, 5, Ciutat Vella, 08003 Barcelona
cocktails, favourite

Imaginative cocktails in a cool, multi-story interior. Awesome place to camp out with a book and people-watch from the lofted area. Lots of unique ingredients in the drinks.

Bocanariz Wine Bar
Carrer de Vallfogona, 12, Gràcia, 08012 Barcelona
wine, food, favourite

Probably the best wine bar I've ever been to. Incredible food (the strachietella is delicious) and a great selection by the glass or bottle. Many natural, organic, and local Catalan wines.

Henry's Bar
Carrer de la Llacuna, 92, Sant Martí, 08018 Barcelona
cocktails, favourite

Owner is from Bushwick and it shows; bar feels like a piece of NYC. Great cocktails, 70's American-diner-style burgers (incl. veggie options), and a cool divey interior.

Granja M. Viader
Carrer d'en Xuclà, 4, Ciutat Vella, 08001 Barcelona

Simple, casual cafe + deli serving traditional Catalan pastries, sandwiches, desserts. The churros and hot chocolate are great.

Bar Manifest
Carrer del Marquès de Barberà, 11, Ciutat Vella, 08001 Barcelona
wine, food, work

Natural wine bar with vintage JBL speakers. Food is pretty decent, and if they're not busy are fine with laptops in the back couches or bar area.

Hidden Coffee El Born
Carrer dels Canvis Vells, 10, Ciutat Vella, 08003 Barcelona
coffee, work

Great coffee with a good amount of space, wifi, and power outlets. Baristas know a lot about coffee and they always have a few different beans to choose from.

PetNat
Carrer dels Ases, 16, Ciutat Vella, 08003 Barcelona
wine, food, favourite

Tapas and natural wine in a cute, small, two-story space. Well-curated selection of wine by the glass or by the bottle. Slightly expensive relative to other options, but worth it.

Carrer del Torrent de l'Olla, 39, Gràcia, 08012 Barcelona
food, beer, coffee, work

Laid-back cafe with brunch, great espresso, and craft beers in an interesting space with eclectic decor and weird widgets all over. Wifi but no power outlets.

La Ikas
Carrer de la Perla, 22, Gràcia, 08012 Barcelona
food, coffee, work

Quaint, simple cafe with a very cute + intimate courtyard in the back. Open late, and somehow always the right amount of busy.

Right Side Coffee Bar
Carrer de l'Arc de Sant Ramon del Call, 11, Ciutat Vella, 08002 Barcelona
coffee, work

Some of the best coffee in Barcelona with a cool, modern, minimalist interior. Some space to sit. It's more expensive than most of the other cafes in the city.

Poblenou Fresh Coffee Roaster
Carrer de Pere IV, 101, Sant Martí, 08018 Barcelona
coffee, work

Great coffee roaster with a large, very well lit space. Was very quiet when I visited which made it a great place to take calls.

coffee, beer, work

Modern, minimal, all-white, all-day cafe with good coffee, food, drinks, and good hours (until ~20:00). Steps from the Metro.
