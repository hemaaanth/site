Henry's Bar

Owner is from Bushwick and it shows; bar is a slice of NYC. Great cocktails, American-style burgers (incl. veggie options), and a cool divey interior.

Imaginative cocktails in a cool, multi-story interior. Awesome place to camp out with a book and people-watch from the lofted area. Lots of unique ingredients in the drinks.

Bocanariz Wine Bar
Carrer de Vallfogona, 12, Gràcia, 08012 Barcelona

Probably the best wine bar I've ever been to. Incredible food (the strachietella is delicious) and a great selection by the glass or bottle. Many natural, organic, and local Catalan wines.

Simple, casual cafe + deli serving traditional Catalan pastries, sandwiches, desserts. The churros and hot chocolate are very well made.

Bar Manifest
Carrer del Marquès de Barberà, 11, Ciutat Vella, 08001 Barcelona
wine, food

Natural wine bar with vintage JBL speakers. Food is pretty decent, and if they're not busy are fine with laptops in the back couches or bar area.

Hidden Coffee El Born
Carrer dels Canvis Vells, 10, Ciutat Vella, 08003 Barcelona
coffee, work, favourite

Great coffee with a good amount of space, wifi, and power outlets. Baristas know a lot about coffee and they always have a few different options for beans.

PetNat
Carrer dels Ases, 16, Ciutat Vella, 08003 Barcelona
wine, food, favourite

Tapas and natural wine in a cute, small, two-story space. Well-curated selection of wine by the glass or by the bottle. Slightly expensive relative to other options but worth it.

food, drink, coffee, work

Laid-back cafe with brunch, great espresso, and craft beers in an interesting space with eclectic decor and weird widgets all over. Wifi but no power outlets.
