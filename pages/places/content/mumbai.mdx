Best cocktails in the city, bar none. The Satin, Muslin, and the Banarasi are all excellent, and the interior courtyard is gorgeous.

Lively Italian restaurant with handmade pastas and pizza. It's usually booked out at least a few days in advance, so plan ahead.

Casual all-day spot with unexpectedly great, complex cocktails. The food menu is all over (Chinese, Indian, Italian) but also good.
