J. Boroski

cocktails, work

Custom, "no menu" cocktail bar; usually that's a gimmick but they do it very well here. Open very late every day (3am) with a quiet, chill atmosphere. Great place for a night cap.

TEP Bar
TEP Bar
cocktails, food

Unique in many ways: unique cocktails with Thai spirits (food is pretty good too), and unique, live traditional Thai music from 8pm onward every night.

High-energy atmosphere, with great music and great service. The "Soap and Stone" cocktail is incredible and worth a visit just to try that, though you'll probably stay for more.

cocktails

Probably the best cocktails in Thailand and contender for the continent. Very unique cocktail menu that you can't find anywhere else. Dark, mysterious interior.

cocktails, work

Hotel lobby bars are rarely great but Firefly's an exception to the rule. Drinks are great, live jazz every day from 8-11pm, very nice interior. Can easily camp out with a laptop.

Rabbit Hole
Rabbit Hole
cocktails

Very high-energy cocktail bar, great for a night out. The "Mexico City" (mezcal cocktail with salsa + nachos) is a must-try. Close to J. Boroski, 008, and Dry Wave (all on this list).

Great place to get work done. Very bright, airy, with really good coffee and lots of space. Has a courtyard, some indoor seating, and some hyrbid indoor/outdoor space as well.

cocktails

Very swanky vibe (big leather seating, dim lighting, etc.). Live music on Wednesdays, VERY hi-fi sound system. Cocktails are great too, with high-quality ingredients.
