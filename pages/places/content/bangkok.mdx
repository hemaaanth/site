J. Boroski
16, 125/13 Thong Lo, Khwaeng Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10110, Thailand
cocktails, work, favourite

Custom, "no menu" cocktail bar; usually that's a gimmick but they do it very well here. Open very late every day (3:00) with a quiet, chill atmosphere. Great place for a night cap.

TEP Bar
69 ซ. นานา Pom Prap, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100, Thailand
cocktails, food, favourite

Unique in many ways: unique cocktails with Thai spirits (food is pretty good too), and unique, live traditional Thai music from 20:00 onward every night.

Dry Wave Cocktail Studio
2nd Floor SODALITY, 263 Thong Lo 13 Alley, 10110, Thailand
cocktails, favourite

High-energy atmosphere, with great music and great service. The "Soap and Stone" cocktail is incredible and worth a visit just to try that, though it's easy to end up staying for more.

Bar Us
61/37 Floor, Opposite side of security kiosk ( Glass door) Floor 1, 1 Soi Sukhumvit 26, Khlong Tan, Khlong Toei, Bangkok 10110, Thailand
cocktails, favourite

Probably the best cocktails in Thailand, and contender for the continent. Very unique cocktail menu that you can't find anywhere else. Dark, mysterious interior.

Firefly Bar
80 Soi Ton Son, Lumphini, Pathum Wan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand
cocktails, work

Hotel lobby bars are rarely great, but Firefly's an exception to that rule. Drinks are great, live jazz every day from 8-11pm, very nice interior. Can easily camp out with a laptop.

Rabbit Hole
125 Thong Lo, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok 10110, Thailand
cocktails

Very high-energy cocktail bar, great for a night out. The "Mexico City" (mezcal cocktail with salsa + nachos) is a must-try. Close to J. Boroski, 008, and Dry Wave (all on this list).

Great place to get work done. Very bright, airy, with really good coffee and lots of space. Has a courtyard, some indoor seating, and some hyrbid indoor/outdoor space as well.

008 Bar
88 Muu Bangkok hotel 322 ชั้น 11 Thong Lo, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok 10110, Thailand
cocktails

Very swanky vibe (big leather seating, dim lighting, etc.). Live music on Wednesdays, VERY hi-fi sound system. Cocktails are great too, with high-quality ingredients.
